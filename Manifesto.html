Manifesto: Formalizing the Frontier
In an era where AI systems sometimes overclaim solutions to Millennium Problems, we choose a different path: radical intellectual honesty.
The Prime Inertia Engine does not claim to solve the Riemann Hypothesis. Instead, it does something more powerful — it draws the precise boundary between what is known and what remains unknown.
By isolating the Spectral Correspondence Axiom, we have transformed a historically speculative approach into a crystal-clear map. Every modular transformation, every integration-by-parts step, every functional-equation identity is now machine-checked and reproducible. The remaining gap is no longer hidden in prose or hand-waving; it is a single, well-defined statement in the language of Lean 4.
This is the 21st-century way to tackle the hardest problems: not by pretending we have crossed the finish line, but by building a lighthouse that shows exactly how far we still have to sail.
We believe that rigorous conditional formalizations like this one are the fastest route to eventual unconditional proofs — because they let the entire community see, verify, and attack the precise missing piece.

The frontier is still open.

Let us illuminate it together.
